i bring over three decades of software development experience covering a wide range of environments, systems, methods and philosophies that passed by or stayed over the years.

And still: i am hungry for more.

Since 6 years my passion is development for Apple platforms. Mainly iOS / iPadOS but also macOS, watchOS and tvOS focusing on Swift / SwiftUI but coming from an Objective-C background.
